Here's how the app works:

   * When the game starts, you can choose a character by clicking on the fighter's picture. You will fight as that character for the rest of the game.

   * You  must then defeat all of the remaining fighters. Enemies should be moved to a different area of the screen.

   * You choose an opponent by clicking on an enemy's picture.

   * Once you select an opponent, that enemy is moved to a `defender area`.

   * You will now be able to click the `attack` button.
     * Whenever you clicks `attack`, your character damages the defender. The opponent will lose `HP` (health points). These points are displayed at the bottom of the defender's picture. 
     * The opponent character will instantly counter the attack. When that happens, the your character will lose some of their `HP`. These points are shown at the bottom of the your character's picture.
    
You will keep hitting the attack button in an effort to defeat their opponent.

   * When the defender's `HP` is reduced to zero or below, enemy is gonna be removed from the `defender area`. You will be able to a new opponent.

You win the game by defeating all enemy characters. You lose the game if your character's `HP` falls to zero or below and while there are still enemies remaining.
